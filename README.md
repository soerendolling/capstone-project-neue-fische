## Hello there, welcome to my capstone project

Eten = "essen" auf Platt.

I am in the process of developing an App which guides you through a certain amount of questions to find your desired local hamburg restaurant. Whereby I am focussing more on information which existing platforms do not always provide such as the combination of atmosphere and kitchen, size of venue and detailed outside seating.
